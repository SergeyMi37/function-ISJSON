 This is a coding example working on Caché 2018.1.3  and IRIS 2020.2 
 It will not be kept in sync with new versions      
 It is also NOT serviced by InterSystems Support !

## fast JSON formatting (Caché / Ensemble)
It's also an example for a customized command extension (ZZJSN) in Caché & IRIS 
  
This is the Caché version for fast JSON formatting but it also works in IRIS.   
To allow parallel existence in IRIS this is named ZZJSN

see:
```
USER>ZWRITE jsn  
jsn="{"Name":"Li,Robert K.","SSN":"672-92-9664","DOB":"1975-01-12","Home":{"Street":"986 Washington Blvd","City":"Boston","State":"PA","Zip":"95802"},"Office":{"Street":"6012 First Place","City":"Reston","State":"MT","Zip":"77739"},"Spouse":{"Name":"Avery,Zelda H.","SSN":"323-13-7437","DOB":"1943-03-27","Home":{"Street":"196 Main Drive","City":"Youngstown","State":"WY","Zip":"53229"},"Office":{"Street":"4056 Franklin Court","City":"Bensonhurst","State":"IA","Zip":"27688"},"FavoriteColors":["Black"],"Age":77},"Age":45,"Title":"Associate Marketing Manager","Salary":10421}" 
```  
This doesn't look so easy to follow.  
So this is a shorthand to save time and reduce mistyping.

The attached ZZJSN.inc is to be included into your %ZLANGC00.mac
```  
USER>ZZJSN jsn        ; does the Output to Terminal / Device
